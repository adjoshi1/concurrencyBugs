DISCUSSION
To solve this problem, we'll write a PHP function named `countSpecialNumbers`. This function will iterate through each number in the provided array, check if it meets our criteria (greater than 20, first digit even, last digit odd), and keep a count of how many numbers satisfy these conditions.

This code snippet defines the `countSpecialNumbers` function, which implements the logic described in the problem statement. It also includes a `check` function to verify the correctness of the solution with given data points.

I apologize for the confusion. The provided code snippet is already a valid PHP script and does not require any modifications for execution. It defines a function `countSpecialNumbers` that counts numbers in an array that are greater than 20 with an even first digit and an odd last digit. The `check` function is used to verify the correctness of the solution with given data points.

To run the script, save it to a file (e.g., `count_special_numbers.php`), and then execute it from the command line using the PHP interpreter:

This will output whether each test case passed or failed based on the criteria defined in the `countSpecialNumbers` function.

DISCUSSION
To solve this problem, we'll write a PHP function named `countSpecialNumbers`. This function will iterate through each number in the provided array, check if it meets our criteria (greater than 20, first digit even, last digit odd), and keep a count of how many numbers satisfy these conditions.

This code snippet defines the `countSpecialNumbers` function, which implements the logic described in the problem statement. It also includes a `check` function to verify the correctness of the solution with given data points.

I apologize for the confusion. The provided code snippet is already a valid PHP script and does not require any modifications for execution. It defines a function `countSpecialNumbers` that counts numbers in an array that are greater than 20 with an even first digit and an odd last digit. The `check` function is used to verify the correctness of the solution with given data points.

To run the script, save it to a file (e.g., `count_special_numbers.php`), and then execute it from the command line using the PHP interpreter:

This will output whether each test case passed or failed based on the criteria defined in the `countSpecialNumbers` function.

DISCUSSION
To solve this problem, we'll write a PHP function named `countSpecialNumbers`. This function will iterate through each number in the provided array, check if it meets our criteria (greater than 20, first digit even, last digit odd), and keep a count of how many numbers satisfy these conditions.

This code snippet defines the `countSpecialNumbers` function, which implements the logic described in the problem statement. It also includes a `check` function to verify the correctness of the solution with given data points.

I apologize for the confusion. The provided code snippet is already a valid PHP script and does not require any modifications for execution. It defines a function `countSpecialNumbers` that counts numbers in an array that are greater than 20 with an even first digit and an odd last digit. The `check` function is used to verify the correctness of the solution with given data points.

To run the script, save it to a file (e.g., `count_special_numbers.php`), and then execute it from the command line using the PHP interpreter:

This will output whether each test case passed or failed based on the criteria defined in the `countSpecialNumbers` function.

DISCUSSION
To solve this problem, we'll write a PHP function named `countSpecialNumbers`. This function will iterate through each number in the provided array, check if it meets our criteria (greater than 20, first digit even, last digit odd), and keep a count of how many numbers satisfy these conditions.

This code snippet defines the `countSpecialNumbers` function, which implements the logic described in the problem statement. It also includes a `check` function to verify the correctness of the solution with given data points.

I apologize for the confusion. The provided code snippet is already a valid PHP script and does not require any modifications for execution. It defines a function `countSpecialNumbers` that counts numbers in an array that are greater than 20 with an even first digit and an odd last digit. The `check` function is used to verify the correctness of the solution with given data points.

To run the script, save it to a file (e.g., `count_special_numbers.php`), and then execute it from the command line using the PHP interpreter:

This will output whether each test case passed or failed based on the criteria defined in the `countSpecialNumbers` function.
